PaperTrade-Frontend is the client side of my whole papertrasde project. This project's purpose was intended for users to be able to use the stock market without taking any risk.
Paper Trade gives you fake money to trade real stocks like some of the biggest companies like Apple, Amazon and so forth.
We have made the app in a way for each person to have their own profile (just like other big stock trading websites) with a set about of $50,000 to start trading.

What we have done to make this project possible, in the frontend we used ReactJs, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. We also have fetched data from a public API to load a large variety of stocks to trade from. We created different components and pages to navigate easily through the application using link tags from react router dom.
